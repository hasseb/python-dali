Changes
=======

0.11 (2024-05-03)
-----------------

- Frame exception updates; See below. The ``new_exceptions`` parameter
  has been removed from the ``Frame()`` constructor and the
  ``Frame.pack_len()`` method.

- Method to control the power supply in the Lunatone DALI USB 30ma
  added to ``dali.driver.hid.tridonic`` [mbecker]

- Improved support for colour-control devices (device type 8) [jktjkt]

- Driver for Lunatine SCI RS232 [opieters]

- Driver for AL-DALI-HAT [rijimuge]

- Bug fixes to input device support [jktjkt]

Frame exception updates
-----------------------

The exceptions raised by ``dali.frame.Frame()`` and the
``Frame.pack_len()`` method are changing. In release versions <= 0.8,
if you pass an invalid sequence to initialise a ``Frame`` a
``TypeError`` will be raised. In release 0.9 this changed to
``ValueError``. If you pass an invalid length to ``pack_len()``,
currently a ``ValueError`` will be raised. In release 0.9 this changed
to ``OverflowError``.

To obtain the new behaviour when using release 0.8, pass
``new_exceptions=True`` to ``Frame()`` and ``pack_len()``. In release
0.9, you can to continue to obtain the old behaviour by passing
``new_exceptions=False``. In the release after that (provisionally
"0.10"), passing any value for ``new_exceptions`` will issue a warning
and in the release after *that*, the ``new_exceptions`` keyword
argument will be removed.

The new behaviour makes the library more consistent with the
exceptions raised by the native ``int.from_bytes()`` and
``int.to_bytes()`` methods.

0.10 (2022-10-24)
-----------------

- Python 3.6 is no longer supported.

- Frame exception updates; see above. The old behaviour is no longer
  available and passing ``new_exceptions`` when calling the
  ``Frame()`` constructor or the ``Frame.pack_len()`` method will
  issue a warning.

- The ``dali.address`` classes for gear and devices have been
  separated. ``dali.address.Short()`` has been split into
  ``dali.address.GearShort()`` and ``dali.address.DeviceShort()``;
  similar changes have been made to ``Group()``, ``Broadcast()`` and
  ``BroadcastUnaddressed()``. The old names are still present and
  usable for gear, and there is no plan to remove them. [sl-wallace]

- The 24-bit command support in ``dali.device.general`` has been
  improved: commands now have appropriate ``Response`` types. This
  code has now been tested against real hardware. [sl-wallace]

- The memory subsystem now supports access to the memory banks of
  24-bit control devices as well as 16-bit control gear. [sl-wallace]

- 24-bit event messages are supported. [sl-wallace]

- Support has been added for pushbutton devices (IEC 62386 part
  301). [sl-wallace]

- 24-bit frame support has been added to the async Tridonic
  driver. [sde1000]

- A driver has been added for Lunatone LUBA serial DALI
  interfaces. [sl-wallace]

- Support for colour devices (device type 8) has been added.
  [sl-wallace / Petr Ilgner]

- Support for occupancy sensors (IEC 62386 part 303). [sl-wallace]

- Support for light sensors (IEC 62386 part 304). [sl-wallace]

0.9 (2022-04-21)
----------------

- ``Command._devicetype``, ``Command.is_config`` and
  ``Command._response`` have been removed. (They were deprecated in
  release 0.7.)

- Frame exception updates; see above. The new behaviour is now the
  default, and the old behaviour can be accessed by passing
  ``new_exceptions=False`` when calling the ``Frame()`` constructor
  and the ``Frame.pack_len()`` method.

- Updated the Hasseb driver to use a more generally available HID
  library [dgomes]

0.8 (2021-12-02)
----------------

- Memory bank subsystem: command sequences to access and interpret the
  contents of memory banks [ferdinandkeil, sde1000]

- Frame exception updates; see above. The new behaviour can be
  accessed in this release by passing ``new_exceptions=True`` when
  calling the ``Frame()`` constructor and the ``Frame.pack_len()``
  method.

- Driver updates [jbaptperez, awahlig, rousveiga, rnixx]

0.7.1 (2020-09-02)
------------------

- Remove unused problematic imports from ``dali.driver.hasseb``
  [dgomes]

0.7 (2020-08-10)
----------------

- Frame improvements: add ``pack_len()`` method and simplify
  ``str(BackwardFrame())`` output

- Add ``Response.raw_value`` attribute to ``Response`` objects to give
  access to the underlying ``BackwardFrame`` of the response (or
  ``None`` if no response was received)

- Add ``NumericResponse`` and ``NumericResponseMask`` classes and make
  use of them where appropriate

- Rename some ``Command`` class attributes, removing the initial ``_``
  to indicate that they are public. The API now supports
  ``Command.response``, ``Command.devicetype``,
  ``Command.uses_dtr{0,1,2}``, ``Command.inputdev`` and
  ``Command.appctrl`` attributes.

- Add support for "sequences" of commands that implement higher-level
  operations. Initial sequences include commisioning of control gear
  (discovering bus units and assigning short addresses), reading the
  list of device types, querying and setting group membership.

- Remove the obsolete ``dali.bus`` module; all of the useful code from
  it is now implemented as sequences

- 4–5× performance improvement of the ``command.from_frame()``
  function

- Remove support for Python 2

- Some driver additions and changes [sde1000, hasseb, mhemeryck]


0.6 (2018-11-11)
----------------

- Python 3 fix in async Tridonic driver
  [jjonek]

- Updated Hasseb driver
  [dgomes]


0.5 (2017-05-15)
----------------

- Move tests to dedicated package.
  [rnix]

- Rename ``dali.device.Device._addressobj`` to
  ``dali.device.Device.address_obj`` since it is used as API in
  ``dali.command.Command``.
  [rnix]

- Move ``dali.device.Device`` class to ``dali.bus``, ``dali.device`` module
  has been removed which conflicted with ``dali.device`` package.
  [rnix]

- Add ``dali.exceptions`` module and move all DALI related exceptions to it.
  [rnix]

- Move ``dali.interfaces`` to ``dali.drivers.daliserver``.
  [rnix]
